    <h3>Where they are from?</h3>
    Rachel is a Jersey Girl, raised in Marlboro, just an hour outside of New York.
    Justin is a nice jewish boy from Pittsburgh.
    But they've lived in DC so long they are technically Washingtonians.

    <h3>How did they met?</h3>

    On a starry halloween night in 2009, an arabian prince picked up a scarecrow
    at the bar/ballroom in Arlington. Drinks were had. Numbers were exchanged.

    <H3>How about the first date?</h3>
    I guess that depends on who you ask.  If you ask Justin, it was over drinks
    at a sports bar in Dupont circle where Justin confirmed Rachel did indeed exist. If
    you ask Rachel, it was when Justin took Rachel for a nice dinner at a classy
    restaurant about a week later.

    <h3>One year anniversary?</h3>
    Justin ceeded his Penguins to Rachel's die hard love of
    the New Jersey Devils (and the Caps so long as they aren't playing the Devils).
    He surprised her with club level tickets right
    in the middle of the ice.

    <h3>How long before Justin popped the question?</h3>
    Rachel has always wanted to visit Italy.  But more importantly, Rachel
    informed Justin that "if he likes it he should put a ring on it."
    Rings were bought.  Tickets were purchased for Italy (killed two birds
    with one stone!) and that's what brings us here today!

    <h3>Favorite DC restaurant?</h3>
    Lauriol plaza!  It's just a big box Mexcian restaurant, but they are in
    love.  They drink lots o' sangria or margaritas (mood dependent), eat too much
    chips n' salsa, then stuff themselves with quesadillas and
    fajitas.

    <h3>I heard they both travel a lot?  Where to?</h3>
    Justin and Rachel both are blessed with jobs that take them all over the
    world: London, Paris, Zurich, Israel.  That said, the fun stuff is when
    they travel together.  Their first trip was on a cruise in the Caribbean.
    Next came a biggee. They wanted to see if they could survive together for
    a month on the other side of the world: New Zealand and Australia.  They
    passed!

    Since then, they've been all over Europe together, and Justin convinced
    Rachel to get scuba certified in Belize.  They hope there will be many
    more adventures to come!

    <h3>Who's the maid of honor?</h3>
    That would be Rachel's super funny and extremely talented best friend and
    younger sister, Lisa Michelle.  Sisters by blood, best friends by choice.

    <h3>Who's the other sexy guy in the tuxedo?</h3>

    That must be Stas. He and Justin met in middle school and have been best
    friends forever. Stas and Just went to high school together, split apart
    for college, and now live only a few miles away from one another.
